Credit due where credit is due
******************************

Much of this package is inspired by the hurry.jquery package written by Jan-Wijbrand Kolman,
that in turn could not exist without the very cool hurry.resource package written
by Martijn Faasen. Thanks!
Of course thanks to Dmitry Baranovskiy for creating to wonderful Raphael lib!
